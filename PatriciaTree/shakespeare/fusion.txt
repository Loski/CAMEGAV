earl
of
westmoreland
sir
walter
blunt
and
others
king
henry
iv
so
shaken
as
we
are
so
wan
with
care
find
we
a
time
for
frighted
peace
to
pant
and
breathe
short
winded
accents
of
new
broils
to
be
commenced
in
strands
afar
remote
no
more
the
thirsty
entrance
of
this
soil
shall
daub
her
lips
with
her
own
children
s
blood
nor
more
shall
trenching
war
channel
her
fields
nor
bruise
her
flowerets
with
the
armed
hoofs
of
hostile
paces
those
opposed
eyes
which
like
the
meteors
of
a
troubled
heaven
all
of
one
nature
of
one
substance
bred
did
lately
meet
in
the
intestine
shock
and
furious
close
of
civil
butchery
shall
now
in
mutual
well
beseeming
ranks
march
all
one
way
and
be
no
more
opposed
against
acquaintance
kindred
and
allies
the
edge
of
war
like
an
ill
sheathed
knife
no
more
shall
cut
his
master
therefore
friends
as
far
as
to
the
sepulchre
of
christ
whose
soldier
now
under
whose
blessed
cross
we
are
impressed
and
engaged
to
fight
forthwith
a
power
of
english
shall
we
levy
whose
arms
were
moulded
in
their
mothers
womb
to
chase
these
pagans
in
those
holy
fields
over
whose
acres
walk
d
those
blessed
feet
which
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
were
nail
d
for
our
advantage
on
the
bitter
cross
but
this
our
purpose
now
is
twelve
month
old
and
bootless
tis
to
tell
you
we
will
go
therefore
we
meet
not
now
then
let
me
hear
of
you
my
gentle
cousin
westmoreland
what
yesternight
our
council
did
decree
in
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
westmoreland
my
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
and
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
but
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
a
post
from
wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
mortimer
leading
the
men
of
herefordshire
to
fight
against
the
irregular
and
wild
glendower
was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
welshman
taken
a
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
such
beastly
shameless
transformation
by
those
welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
king
henry
iv
it
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
brake
off
our
business
for
the
holy
land
westmoreland
this
match
d
with
other
did
my
gracious
lord
for
more
uneven
and
unwelcome
news
came
from
the
north
and
thus
it
did
import
on
holy
rood
day
the
gallant
hotspur
there
young
harry
percy
and
brave
archibald
that
ever
valiant
and
approved
scot
at
holmedon
met
where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
as
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
and
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
for
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
and
pride
of
their
contention
did
take
horse
uncertain
of
the
issue
any
way
king
henry
iv
here
is
a
dear
a
true
industrious
friend
sir
walter
blunt
new
lighted
from
his
horse
stain
d
with
the
variation
of
each
soil
betwixt
that
holmedon
and
this
seat
of
ours
and
he
hath
brought
us
smooth
and
welcome
news
the
earl
of
douglas
is
discomfited
ten
thousand
bold
scots
two
and
twenty
knights
balk
d
in
their
own
blood
did
sir

see
on
holmedon

plains

earl
of
fife
and
eldest
son
to
beaten
douglas
and
the
earl
of
athol
of
murray
angus
and
menteith
and
is
not
this
an
honourable
spoil
a
gallant
prize
ha
cousin
is
it
not
westmoreland
in
faith
it
is
a
conquest
for
a
prince
to
boast
of
king
henry
iv
yea
there
thou
makest
me
sad
and
makest
me
sin
in
envy
that
my
lord
northumberland
should
be
the
father
to
so
blest
a
son
a
son
who
is
the
theme
of
honour
s
tongue
amongst
a
grove
the
very
straightest
plant
who
is
sweet
fortune
s
minion
and
her
pride
whilst
i
by
looking
on
the
praise
of
him
see
riot
and
dishonour
stain
the
brow
of
my
young
harry
o
that
it
could
be
proved
that
some
night
tripping
fairy
had
exchanged
in
cradle
clothes
our
children
where
they
lay
and
call
d
mine
percy
his
plantagenet
then
would
i
have
his
harry
and
he
mine
but
let
him
from
my
thoughts
what
think
you
coz
of
this
young
percy
s
pride
the
prisoners
which
he
in
this
adventure
hath
surprised
to
his
own
use
he
keeps
and
sends
me
word
i
shall
have
none
but
mordake
earl
of
fife
westmoreland
this
is
his
uncle
s
teaching
this
is
worcester
malevolent
to
you
in
all
aspects
which
makes
him
prune
himself
and
bristle
up
the
crest
of
youth
against
your
dignity
king
henry
iv
but
i
have
sent
for
him
to
answer
this
and
for
this
cause
awhile
we
must
neglect
our
holy
purpose
to
jerusalem
cousin
on
wednesday
next
our
council
we
will
hold
at
windsor
so
inform
the
lords
but
come

with
speed
to
us

wouldst
truly
know
what
a
devil
hast

my
good
sweet
honey

i
have
a
jest
to
execute
that
i
cannot
manage
alone
falstaff
bardolph
peto
and
gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid
yourself
and
i
will
not
be
there
and
when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
i
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
off
from
my
shoulders
prince
henry
how
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
poins
why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
we
ll
set
upon
them
prince
henry
yea
but
tis
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
poins
tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
see
i
ll
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
vizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
i
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
immask
our
noted
outward
garments
prince
henry
yea
but
i
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
poins
well
for
two
of
them
i
know
them
to
be
as
true
bred
cowards
as
ever
turned
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
i
ll
forswear
arms
the
virtue
of
this
jest
will
be
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
prince
henry
well
i
ll
go
with
thee
provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
to
morrow
night
in
eastcheap
there
i
ll
sup
farewell

farewell
my
lord
exit
poins
prince
henry
i
know
you
all
and
will
awhile
uphold
the
unyoked
humour
of
your
idleness
yet
herein
will
i
imitate
the
sun
who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
to
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
that
when
he
please
again
to
be
himself
being
wanted

guilty
of
this
fault
and
not
my

hotspur
my
liege
i
did
deny
no

i
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
when
i
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreme
toil
breathless
and
faint
leaning
upon
my
sword
came
there
a
certain
lord
neat
and
trimly
dress
d
fresh
as
a
bridegroom
and
his
chin
new
reap
d
show
d
like
a
stubble
land
at
harvest
home
he
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
and
twixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
held
a
pouncet
box
which
ever
and
anon
he
gave
his
nose
and
took
t
away
again
who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
took
it
in
snuff
and
still
he
smiled
and
talk
d
and
as
the
soldiers
bore
dead
bodies
by
he
call
d
them
untaught
knaves
unmannerly
to
bring
a
slovenly
unhandsome
corse
betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
with
many
holiday
and
lady
terms
he
question
d
me
amongst
the
rest
demanded
my
prisoners
in
your

i
then
all
smarting
with
my
wounds
being
cold
to
be
so
pester
d
with
a
popinjay
out
of
my
grief
and
my
impatience
answer
d
neglectingly
i
know
not
what
he
should
or
he
should
not

he
made
me
mad
to
see
him
shine
so
brisk
and
smell
so
sweet
and
talk
so
like
a
waiting
gentlewoman
of
guns
and
drums
and
wounds
god
save
the
mark
and
telling
me
the
sovereign
st
thing
on

was
parmaceti
for
an
inward
bruise
and
that
it
was
great
pity
so
it
was

villanous
salt
petre
should
be

d
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
destroy
d
so
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
guns
he
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
this
bald
unjointed
chat
of
his
my
lord
i
answer
d
indirectly
as
i
said
and
i
beseech
you

not
his

reasonably
die

with
proviso
and
exception
that
we
at

own
charge
shall
ransom
straight
his
brother

foolish
mortimer
who
on
my

hath
wilfully
betray

that
he
did
lead

against
that
great
magician

we

hath

never
did
fall
off
my
sovereign

by
the
chance
of
war
to
prove
that
true
needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
those
mouthed
wounds
which
valiantly
he
took
when
on
the
gentle
severn
s
sedgy
bank
in
single
opposition
hand
to
hand
he
did
confound
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
changing
hardiment
with
great
glendower
three
times
they
breathed
and
three
times
did
they
drink
upon
agreement
of
swift
severn
s
flood
who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
looks
ran
fearfully
among
the
trembling
reeds
and
hid
his
crisp
head
in
the
hollow
bank
bloodstained
with
these
valiant
combatants
never
did
base
and
rotten
policy
colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
nor
could
the
noble

so
many

yea
on
his
part
i
ll
empty
all
these
veins
and
shed
my
dear
blood
drop
by
drop
in
the
dust
but
i
will
lift
the
down
trod
mortimer
as
high
in
the
air
as
this
unthankful
king
as
this
ingrate
and
canker
d
bolingbroke
northumberland
brother
the
king
hath
made
your
nephew
mad
earl
of
worcester
who
struck
this
heat
up
after
i
was
gone
hotspur
he
will
forsooth
have
all
my
prisoners
and
when
i
urged
the
ransom
once
again
of
my
wife
s
brother
then
his
cheek
look
d
pale
and
on
my
face
he
turn
d
an
eye
of
death
trembling
even
at
the
name
of
mortimer
earl
of
worcester
i
cannot
blame
him
was
not
he
proclaim
d
by
richard
that
dead
is
the
next
of
blood
northumberland
he
was
i
heard
the
proclamation
and
then
it
was
when
the
unhappy
king
whose
wrongs
in
us
god
pardon
did
set
forth
upon
his
irish
expedition
from
whence
he
intercepted
did
return
to
be
deposed
and
shortly
murdered
earl
of
worcester
and
for
whose
death
we
in
the
world
s
wide
mouth
live
scandalized
and
foully
spoken
of
hotspur
but
soft
i
pray
you
did
king
richard
then
proclaim
my
brother
edmund
mortimer
heir
to
the
crown
northumberland
he
did
myself
did
hear
it
hotspur
nay
then
i
cannot
blame
his
cousin
king
that
wished
him
on
the
barren
mountains
starve
but
shall
it
be
that
you
that
set
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
this
forgetful
man
and
for
his
sake
wear
the
detested
blot
of
murderous
subornation
shall
it
be
that
you
a
world
of
curses
undergo
being
the
agents
or
base
second
means
the
cords
the
ladder
or
the
hangman
rather
o
pardon
me
that
i
descend
so
low
to
show
the
line
and
the
predicament
wherein
you
range
under
this
subtle
king
shall
it
for
shame
be
spoken
in
these
days
or
fill
up
chronicles
in
time
to
come
that
men
of
your
nobility
and
power
did
gage
them
both
in
an
unjust
behalf
as
both
of
you
god
pardon
it
have
done
to
put
down
richard
that
sweet
lovely
rose
an
plant
this
thorn
this
canker
bolingbroke
and
shall
it
in
more
shame
be
further
spoken
that
you
are
fool
d
discarded
and
shook
off
by
him
for
whom
these
shames
ye
underwent
no
yet
time
serves
wherein
you
may
redeem
your
banish
d
honours
and
restore
yourselves
into
the
good
thoughts
of
the
world
again
revenge
the
jeering
and
disdain
d
contempt
of
this
proud
king
who
studies
day
and
night
to
answer
all
the
debt
he
owes
to
you
even
with
the
bloody
payment
of
your
deaths
therefore
i
say
earl
of
worcester
peace
cousin
say
no
more
and
now
i
will
unclasp
a
secret
book
and
to
your
quick
conceiving
discontents
i
ll
read
you
matter
deep
and
dangerous
as
full
of
peril
and
adventurous
spirit
as
to
o
er
walk
a
current
roaring
loud
on
the
unsteadfast
footing
of
a
spear
hotspur
if
he
fall
in
good
night
or
sink
or
swim
send
danger
from
the
east
unto
the
west
so
honour
cross
it
from
the
north
to
south
and
let
them
grapple
o
the
blood
more
stirs
to
rouse
a
lion
than
to
start
a
hare
northumberland
imagination
of
some
great
exploit
drives
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
hotspur
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
pale
faced
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
fathom
line
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
so
he
that
doth
redeem
her
thence
might
wear
without
corrival
all
her
dignities
but
out
upon
this
half
faced
fellowship
earl
of
worcester
he
apprehends
a
world
of
figures
here
but
not
the
form
of
what
he
should
attend
good
cousin
give
me
audience
for
a
while

of

scot

unto
my
purposes

will
find
him
when

lies
asleep
and

his
ear
i

nay
i
ll
have
a
starling

sooner
it

that
thou
art
my

i
have
partly
thy

s
word
partly
my
own
opinion
but
chiefly
a
villanous
trick
of
thine
eye
and
a
foolish
hanging
of
thy
nether
lip
that
doth
warrant
me
if
then
thou
be

here
lies
the
point

so
pointed
at

prove
a
micher
and
eat
blackberries
a

shall
the

a
question

there
is
a

harry

thou
hast
often
heard
of

it
is
known
to
many
in
our
land
by
the
name
of

this
pitch

do
report
doth
defile
so
doth
the

thou
keepest
for
harry
now
i
do
not
speak
to
thee
in
drink
but
in
tears
not
in
pleasure
but
in
passion
not
in
words

but
in
woes
also
and
yet
there
is
a
virtuous
man
whom
i
have
often
noted
in
thy

i
know
not
his

think
his
age

fifty

by

inclining
to
three
score
and
now
i
remember
me
his
name
is
falstaff
if
that

should
be
lewdly
given
he
deceiveth
me
for
harry

see
virtue
in
his
looks
if
then
the
tree
may
be
known
by
the
fruit
as
the

peremptorily

he

you
in

as
oft
as
he

spoke
of

i
cannot
blame
him
at
my
nativity
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
of
burning
cressets
and
at
my
birth
the
frame
and
huge
foundation
of
the
earth
shaked
like
a
coward
hotspur
why
so
it
would
have
done
at
the

season
if
your
mother

cat
had
but
kittened
though
yourself
had
never
been
born
glendower
i
say
the
earth
did
shake
when
i
was
born
hotspur
and
i
say
the
earth
was
not
of
my
mind
if
you
suppose
as
fearing
you
it
shook
glendower
the
heavens
were
all
on
fire
the
earth
did
tremble
hotspur
o
then
the
earth
shook
to
see
the
heavens
on
fire

continent
as
much
as
on
the
other

it
takes
from
you
earl

worcester
yea
but
a
little
charge
will
trench
him
here
and
on
this
north
side
win
this
cape
of
land
and
then
he
runs
straight

can
speak
english
lord
as
well
as

for
i
was
train
d
up
in
the
english
court
where
being
but
young
i
framed
to
the
harp
many
an
english
ditty
lovely
well
and
gave
the
tongue
a
helpful
ornament
a
virtue
that
was
never
seen
in
you
hotspur
marry
and
i
am
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
i
had
rather
be
a
kitten
and
cry
mew
than
one
of
these
same
metre
ballad
mongers
i
had
rather
hear
a
brazen
canstick
turn
d
or
a
dry
wheel
grate
on
the
axle
tree
and
that
would
set
my
teeth
nothing
on
edge
nothing
so
much
as
mincing
poetry
tis
like
the
forced
gait
of
a
shuffling
nag
glendower
come
you
shall
have
trent
turn
d
hotspur
i
do
not
care
i
ll
give
thrice
so
much
land
to
any
well
deserving
friend
but
in
the
way
of
bargain
mark
ye
me
i
ll
cavil
on
the
ninth
part
of
a
hair
are
the
indentures
drawn
shall
we
be
gone
glendower
the
moon
shines
fair
you
may
away
by
night
i
ll
haste
the
writer
and
withal
break
with
your
wives
of
your
departure
hence
i
am
afraid
my
daughter
will
run
mad
so
much
she
doteth
on
her
mortimer
exit
glendower
mortimer
fie
cousin
percy
how
you
cross
my
father
hotspur
i
cannot
choose
sometime
he
angers
me
with
telling
me
of
the
mouldwarp
and
the
ant
of
the
dreamer
merlin
and
his
prophecies
and
of
a
dragon
and
a
finless
fish
a
clip
wing
d
griffin
and
a
moulten
raven
a
couching
lion
and
a
ramping
cat
and
such
a
deal
of
skimble
skamble
stuff
as
puts
me
from
my
faith
i
tell
you
what
he
held
me
last
night
at
least
nine
hours
in
reckoning
up
the
several
devils
names
that
were
his
lackeys
i
cried
hum
and
well
go
to
but
mark
d
him
not
a
word
o
he
is
as
tedious
as
a
tired
horse
a
railing
wife
worse
than
a
smoky
house
i
had
rather
live
with
cheese
and
garlic
in
a
windmill
far
than
feed
on
cates
and
have
him
talk
to
me
in
any
summer
house
in
christendom
mortimer
in
faith
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
exceedingly
well
read
and
profited
in
strange
concealments
valiant
as
a
lion
and
as
wondrous
affable
and
as
bountiful
as
mines
of
india
shall
i
tell
you
cousin
he
holds
your
temper
in
a
high
respect
and
curbs
himself
even
of
his
natural
scope
when
you
come
cross
his
humour
faith
he
does
i
warrant
you
that
man
is
not
alive
might
so
have
tempted
him
as
you
have
done
without
the
taste
of
danger
and
reproof
but
do
not
use
it
oft
let
me
entreat
you
earl
of
worcester
in
faith
my
lord
you
are
too
wilful
blame
and
since
your
coming
hither
have
done
enough
to
put
him
quite
beside
his
patience
you
must
needs
learn
lord
to
amend
this
fault
though
sometimes
it
show
greatness
courage
blood
and
that
s
the
dearest
grace
it
renders
you
yet
oftentimes
it
doth
present
harsh
rage
defect
of
manners
want
of
government
pride
haughtiness
opinion
and
disdain
the
least
of
which
haunting
a
nobleman
loseth
men
s
hearts
and
leaves
behind
a
stain
upon
the
beauty
of
all
parts
besides
beguiling
them
of
commendation
hotspur
well
i
am
school
d
good

and
let
us

she
answers
him
in
the
same
glendower
she
is
desperate
here
a
peevish
self

harlotry
one
that
no
persuasion
can
do

charming
your

with
pleasing
heaviness
making

for
we
shall
presently
have
need
of
you
exeunt
lords
i
know
not
whether
god
will
have
it
so
for
some
displeasing
service
i
have
done
that
in
his
secret
doom
out
of
my
blood
he
ll
breed
revengement
and
a
scourge
for
me
but
thou
dost
in
thy
passages

that
thou
art

prince
henry
so
please
your
majesty
i
would
i
could
quit
all
offences
with
as
clear
excuse
as
well
as
i
am
doubtless
i
can
purge
myself
of
many
i
am
charged
withal
yet
such
extenuation
let
me
beg
as
in
reproof
of
many
tales
devised
which
oft
the
ear
of
greatness
needs
must
hear
by
smiling
pick
thanks
and
base
news

i
may
for
some
things
true
wherein
my
youth
hath
faulty
wander
d
and
irregular
find
pardon
on
my
true
submission
king
henry
iv
god
pardon
thee
yet
let
me
wonder
harry
at
thy
affections
which
do
hold
a
wing
quite
from
the
flight
of
all
thy
ancestors
thy
place
in
council
thou
hast
rudely
lost
which
by
thy
younger
brother
is
supplied
and
art
almost
an
alien
to
the
hearts
of
all
the
court
and
princes
of
my
blood
the
hope
and
expectation
of
thy
time
is
ruin
d
and
the
soul
of
every
man
prophetically
doth
forethink
thy
fall
had
i
so
lavish
of
my
presence
been
so
common
hackney
d
in
the
eyes
of
men
so
stale
and
cheap
to
vulgar
company
opinion
that
did
help
me
to
the
crown
had
still
kept
loyal
to
possession
and
left
me
in
reputeless
banishment
a
fellow
of
no
mark
nor
likelihood
by
being
seldom
seen
i
could
not
stir
but
like
a
comet
i
was
wonder
d
at
that
men
would
tell
their
children
this
is
he
others
would
say
where
which
is
bolingbroke
and
then
i
stole
all
courtesy
from
heaven
and
dress
d
myself
in
such
humility
that
i
did
pluck
allegiance
from
men
s
hearts
loud
shouts
and
salutations
from
their
mouths
even
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
king
thus
did
i
keep
my
person
fresh
and
new
my
presence
like
a
robe
pontifical
ne
er
seen
but
wonder
d
at
and
so
my
state
seldom
but
sumptuous
showed
like
a
feast
and
won
by
rareness
such
solemnity
the
skipping
king
he
ambled
up
and
down
with
shallow
jesters
and
rash
bavin
wits
soon
kindled
and
soon
burnt
carded
his
state
mingled
his
royalty
with
capering
fools
had
his
great
name
profaned
with
their
scorns
and
gave
his
countenance
against
his
name
to
laugh
at
gibing
boys
and
stand
the
push
of
every
beardless
vain
comparative
grew
a
companion
to
the
common
streets
enfeoff
d
himself
to
popularity
that
being
daily
swallow
d
by
men
s
eyes
they
surfeited
with
honey
and
began
to
loathe
the
taste
of
sweetness
whereof
a
little
more
than
a
little
is
by
much
too
much
so
when
he
had
occasion
to
be
seen
he
was
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
june
heard
not
regarded
seen
but
with
such
eyes
as
sick
and
blunted
with
community
afford
no
extraordinary
gaze
such
as
is
bent
on
sun
like

my

four
days
ere

set
forth
and
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
he
was
much
fear
d
by
his
physicians
earl
of
worcester
i
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
his
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
hotspur
sick
now
droop
now
this
sickness
doth
infect
the
very
life
blood
of
our
enterprise
tis
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
he
writes
me
here
that
inward
sickness
and
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
so
soon
be
drawn
nor
did
he
think
it
meet
to
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
on
any
soul
removed
but
on
his
own
yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
that
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
to
see
how
fortune
is
disposed
to
us
for
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
because
the
king
is
certainly
possess
d
of
all
our
purposes
what
say
you
to
it
earl
of
worcester
your
father
s
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
hotspur
a
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
lopp
d
off
and
yet
in
faith
it
is
not
his
present
want
seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
were
it
good
to
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
all
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
main
on
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
it
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
the
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
the
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
of
all
our
fortunes
earl
of
douglas
faith
and
so
we
should
where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
we
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
is
to
come
in
a
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
hotspur
a
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
if
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
earl
of
worcester
but
yet
i
would
your
father
had
been
here
the
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
brooks
no
division
it
will
be
thought
by
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
that
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
of
our
proceedings
kept
the
earl
from
hence
and
think
how
such
an
apprehension
may
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
and
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
for
well
you
know
we
of
the
offering
side
must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
and
stop
all
sight
holes
every
loop
from
whence
the
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
this
absence
of
your
father
s
draws
a
curtain
that
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
before
not
dreamt
of
hotspur
you
strain
too
far
i
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
it
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
a
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
than
if
the
earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
if
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
to
push
against
a
kingdom
with
his
help
we
shall
o
erturn
it
topsy
turvy
down
yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints

whole

of
our
determination
some
of
us
love
you
well
and
even
those
some
envy
your
great
deservings
and
good
name
because
you
are
not
of
our
quality
but
stand
against
us
like
an
enemy
sir

and
god
defend
but
still
i
should
stand
so
so
long
as
out
of

and
true
rule
you
stand
against
anointed
majesty
but
to
my
charge
the
king
hath
sent
to
know
the
nature
of
your
griefs
and
whereupon
you
conjure
from
the
breast
of
civil
peace
such
bold
hostility
teaching
his
duteous
land
audacious
cruelty
if
that
the
king
have
any
way
your
good
deserts
forgot
which
he
confesseth
to
be
manifold
he
bids
you
name
your
griefs
and
with
all
speed
you
shall
have
your
desires
with
interest
and
pardon
absolute
for
yourself
and
these
herein
misled
by
your
suggestion
hotspur
the
king
is
kind
and
well
we
know
the
king
knows
at
what
time
to
promise
when
to
pay
my
father
and
my
uncle
and
myself
did
give
him
that
same
royalty
he
wears
and
when
he
was
not
six
and
twenty
strong
sick
in
the
world
s
regard
wretched
and
low
a
poor
unminded
outlaw
sneaking
home
my
father
gave
him
welcome
to
the
shore
and
when
he
heard
him
swear
and
vow
to
god
he
came
but
to
be
duke
of
lancaster
to
sue
his
livery
and
beg
his
peace
with
tears
of
innocency
and
terms
of
zeal
my
father
in
kind
heart
and
pity
moved
swore
him
assistance
and
perform
d
it
too
now
when
the
lords
and
barons
of
the
realm
perceived
northumberland
did
lean
to
him
the
more
and
less
came
in
with
cap
and
knee
met
him
in
boroughs
cities

attended
him
on
bridges
stood
in
lanes
laid
gifts
before
him
proffer
d
him
their
oaths
gave
him
their
heirs
as
pages
follow
d
him
even
at
the
heels
in
golden
multitudes
he
presently
as
greatness
knows
itself
steps
me
a
little
higher
than
his
vow
made
to
my
father
while
his
blood
was
poor
upon
the
naked
shore
at
ravenspurgh
and
now
forsooth
takes
on
him
to
reform
some
certain
edicts
and
some
strait
decrees
that
lie
too
heavy
on
the
commonwealth
cries
out
upon
abuses
seems
to
weep
over
his
country
s
wrongs
and
by
this
face
this
seeming
brow
of
justice
did
he
win
the
hearts
of
all
that
he
did
angle

time
after

deposed
the
king
soon
after
that
deprived
him
of
his
life
and
in
the
neck
of
that
task
d
the
whole
state
to
make
that
worse
suffer
d
his
kinsman
march
who
is
if
every
owner
were
well
placed
indeed
his
king
to
be
engaged
in
wales
there
without
ransom
to
lie
forfeited
disgraced

in
my
happy
victories
sought
to
entrap
me
by
intelligence
rated
mine
uncle
from
the
council
board
in
rage
dismiss
d
my
father
from
the
court
broke
oath
on
oath
committed
wrong
on
wrong
and
in
conclusion
drove
us
to
seek
out
this
head
of
safety
and
withal
to
pry
into
his
title
the
which
we
find
too
indirect
for
long
continuance
sir
walter
blunt
shall
i
return
this
answer
to
the
king
hotspur
not
so
sir
walter
we
ll
withdraw
awhile
go

be
impawn
d
some

for
a
safe

and
sir
michael
archbishop
of

hie
good
sir
michael
bear
this
sealed
brief
with
winged
haste
to
the
lord
marshal
this
to
my
cousin
scroop
and
all
the
rest
to
whom
they
are
directed
if
you
knew
how
much
they
do
to
import
you
would
make
haste
sir
michael
my
good
lord
i
guess
their
tenor
archbishop
of
york
like
enough
you
do
to
morrow
good
sir
michael
is
a
day
wherein
the
fortune
of
ten
thousand
men
must
bide
the
touch
for
sir
at
shrewsbury
as
i
am
truly
given
to
understand
the
king
with
mighty
and
quick
raised
power
meets
with
lord
harry
and
i
fear
sir
michael
what
with
the
sickness
of
northumberland
whose
power
was
in
the
first
proportion
and
what
with
owen
glendower
s
absence
thence
who
with
them
was
a
rated
sinew
too
and
comes
not
in
o
er
ruled
by
prophecies
i
fear
the
power
of
percy
is
too
weak
to
wage
an
instant
trial
with
the
king
sir
michael
why
my
good
lord
you
need
not
fear
there
is
douglas
and
lord
mortimer
archbishop
of
york
no
mortimer
is
not
there
sir
michael
but
there
is
mordake
vernon
lord
harry
percy
and
there
is
my
lord
of
worcester
and
a
head
of
gallant
warriors
noble
gentlemen
archbishop
of
york
and
so
there
is
but
yet
the
king
hath
drawn
the
special
head
of
all
the
land
together
the
prince
of
wales
lord
john
of
lancaster
the
noble
westmoreland
and
warlike
blunt
and
moe
corrivals
and
dear
men
of
estimation
and
command
in
arms
sir
michael
doubt
not
my
lord
they
shall
be
well
opposed
archbishop
of
york
i
hope
no
less
yet
needful
tis
to
fear
and
to
prevent
the
worst
sir
michael
speed
for
if
lord
percy
thrive
not
ere
the
king
dismiss
his
power
he
means
to
visit
us
for
he
hath
heard
of
our
confederacy
and
tis
but
wisdom
to
make
strong
against
him
therefore
make
haste
i
must
go
write
again
to
other
friends
and
so
farewell

how
bloodily
the
sun
begins
to
peer
above
yon
busky
hill
the
day
looks
pale
at
his
distemperature
prince
henry
the
southern
wind
doth
play
the
trumpet
to
his
purposes
and
by
his
hollow
whistling
in
the
leaves
foretells
a
tempest
and
a
blustering
day
king
henry
iv
then
with
the
losers
let
it
sympathize
for
nothing
can
seem
foul
to
those
that
win
the
trumpet
sounds
enter
worcester
and
vernon
how
now
my
lord
of
worcester
tis
not
well
that
you
and
i
should
meet
upon
such
terms
as
now
we
meet
you
have
deceived
our
trust
and
made
us
doff
our
easy
robes
of
peace
to
crush
our
old
limbs
in
ungentle
steel
this
is
not
well
my
lord
this
is
not
well
what
say
you
to
it
will
you
again
unknit
this
curlish
knot
of
all
abhorred
war
and
move
in
that
obedient
orb
again
where
you
did
give
a
fair
and
natural
light
and
be
no
more
an
exhaled
meteor
a
prodigy
of
fear
and
a
portent
of
broached
mischief
to
the
unborn
times
earl
of
worcester
hear
me
my
liege
for
mine
own
part
i
could
be
well
content
to
entertain
the
lag
end
of
my
life
with
quiet
hours
for
i
do
protest
i
have
not
sought
the
day
of
this
dislike
king
henry
iv
you
have
not
sought
it
how
comes
it
then
falstaff
rebellion
lay
in
his
way
and
he
found
it
prince
henry
peace
chewet
peace
earl
of
worcester
it
pleased
your
majesty
to
turn
your
looks
of
favour
from
myself
and
all
our
house
and
yet
i
must
remember
you
my
lord
we
were
the
first
and
dearest
of
your
friends
for
you
my
staff
of
office
did
i
break
in
richard
s
time
and
posted
day
and
night
to
meet
you
on
the
way
and
kiss
your
hand
when
yet
you
were
in
place
and
in
account
nothing
so
strong
and
fortunate
as
i
it
was
myself
my
brother
and
his
son
that
brought
you
home
and
boldly
did
outdare
the
dangers
of
the
time
you
swore
to
us
and
you
did
swear
that
oath
at
doncaster
that
you
did
nothing
purpose
gainst
the
state
nor
claim
no
further
than
your
new
fall
n
right
the
seat
of
gaunt
dukedom
of
lancaster
to
this
we
swore
our
aid
but
in
short
space
it
rain
d
down
fortune
showering
on
your
head
and
such
a
flood
of
greatness
fell
on
you
what
with
our
help
what
with
the
absent
king
what
with
the
injuries
of
a
wanton
time
the
seeming
sufferances
that
you
had
borne
and
the
contrarious
winds
that
held
the
king
so
long
in
his
unlucky
irish
wars
that
all
in
england
did
repute
him
dead
and
from
this
swarm
of
fair
advantages
you
took
occasion
to
be
quickly
woo
d
to
gripe
the
general
sway
into
your
hand
forget
your
oath
to
us
at
doncaster
and
being
fed
by
us
you
used
us
so
as
that
ungentle
hull
the
cuckoo
s
bird
useth
the
sparrow
did
oppress
our
nest
grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
that
even
our
love
durst
not
come
near
your
sight
for
fear
of
swallowing
but
with
nimble
wing
we
were
enforced
for
safety
sake
to
fly
out
of
sight
and
raise
this
present
head
whereby
we
stand
opposed
by
such
means
as
you
yourself
have
forged
against
yourself
by
unkind
usage
dangerous
countenance
and
violation
of
all
faith
and
troth
sworn
to
us
in
your
younger
enterprise
king
henry
iv
these
things
indeed
you
have
articulate
proclaim
d
at
market
crosses
read
in
churches
to
face
the
garment
of
rebellion
with
some
fine
colour
that
may
please
the
eye
of
fickle
changelings
and
poor
discontents
which
gape
and
rub
the
elbow
at
the
news
of
hurlyburly
innovation
and
never
yet
did
insurrection
want
such
water
colours
to
impaint
his
cause
nor
moody
beggars
starving
for
a
time
of
pellmell
havoc
and
confusion
prince
henry
in
both
your
armies
there
is
many
a
soul
shall
pay
full
dearly
for
this
encounter
if
once
they
join
in
trial
tell
your
nephew
the
prince
of
wales
doth
join
with
all
the
world
in
praise
of
henry
percy
by
my
hopes
this
present
enterprise
set
off
his
head
i
do
not
think
a
braver
gentleman
more
active
valiant
or
more
valiant
young
more
daring
or
more
bold
is
now
alive
to
grace
this
latter
age
with
noble
deeds
for
my
part
i
may
speak
it
to
my
shame
i
have
a
truant
been
to
chivalry
and
so
i
hear
he
doth
account
me
too
yet
this
before
my
father
s
majesty
i
am
content
that
he
shall
take
the
odds
of
his
great
name
and
estimation
and
will
to
save
the
blood
on
either
side
try
fortune
with
him
in
a
single
fight
king
henry
iv
and
prince
of
wales
so
dare
we
venture
thee
albeit
considerations
infinite
do
make
against
it
no
good
worcester
no
we
love
our
people
well
even
those
we
love
that
are
misled
upon
your
cousin

offer
of
our
grace

be
my
friend
again
and
i
ll
be
his
so
tell
your
cousin
and
bring
me
word
what
he
will
do
but
if
he
will
not
yield
rebuke
and
dread
correction
wait
on
us
and
they
shall
do
their
office
so
be
gone
we
will
not
now
be
troubled
with
reply

that

or
take
away
the
grief
of
a

no

it
cannot
be
the

suspect
us
still
and
find
a
time
to
punish
this
offence
in
other
faults
suspicion
all

still
dispraising
praise

which
became
him
like
a
prince

made
a
blushing
cital
of
himself

chid
his
truant
youth
with
such
a
grace
as
if

there
a
double
spirit
of

the
true

why
there

the

judge
yourself

i
in

doting
on

wears
out
his

such

their

attending
on

of

well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they

lined
their

some

such
a

this
thou

answer
i

roderigo
roderigo
sir
i
will
answer
any
thing
but
i
beseech
you
if
t
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
as
partly
i
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
at
this
odd
even
and
dull
watch
o
the
night
transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
but
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
to
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
moor
if
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
we
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
but
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
we
have
your
wrong
rebuke
do
not
believe
that
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
i
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
i
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
in
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
of
here
and
every
where
straight
satisfy
yourself
if
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
for
thus
deluding
you
brabantio
strike
on
the
tinder
ho
give
me
a
taper
call
up
all
my
people
this
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
light
i
say
light
exit
above
iago
farewell
for
i
must
leave
you
it
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
to
be
produced
as
if
i
stay
i
shall
against
the
moor
for
i
do
know
the
state
however
this
may
gall
him
with
some
cheque
cannot
with
safety
cast
him
for
he
s
embark
d
with
such
loud
reason
to
the
cyprus
wars
which
even
now
stand
in
act
that
for
their
souls
another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
to
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
though
i
do
hate
him
as
i
do
hell
pains
yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
i
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
which
is
indeed
but
sign
that
you
shall
surely
find
him
lead
to
the
sagittary
the
raised
search
and
there
will
i
be
with
him
so
farewell
exit
enter
below
brabantio
and
servants
with
torches
brabantio
it
is
too
true
an
evil
gone
she
is
and
what
s
to
come
of
my
despised
time
is
nought
but
bitterness
now
roderigo
where
didst
thou
see
her
o
unhappy
girl
with
the
moor
say
st
thou
who
would
be
a

it
very
stuff

the
conscience
to

no
contrived
murder

lack
iniquity

othello
tis
better
as
it
is
iago
nay
but
he
prated

spoke
such
scurvy
and
provoking
terms
against
your
honour
that
with
the
little
godliness
i
have
i
did
full
hard
forbear
him
but
i
pray
you

fast
married

assured
of

the
magnifico

much
beloved

mock
run
from

bosom
of
such
a
thing
as
thou

how

you
by
this
change
first
senator
this
cannot
be
by
no
assay
of
reason
tis
a
pageant
to
keep
us
in
false
gaze
when
we
consider
the
importancy
of
cyprus
to
the
turk
and
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
that
as
it
more
concerns
the
turk
than
rhodes
so
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
for
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
but
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
that
rhodes
is
dress
d
in
if
we
make
thought
of
this
we
must
not
think
the
turk
is
so
unskilful
to
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain
to
wake
and
wage
a
danger
profitless

abused

for

so
preposterously
to

or
lame
of

whoe

he
be
that
in
this
foul
proceeding
hath
thus
beguiled
your
daughter
of

and
you
of
her
the
bloody
book
of
law
you
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
after
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
stood
in
your
action
brabantio
humbly
i
thank
your
grace
here
is
the
man
this
moor
whom
now
it
seems
your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
hath
hither
brought
duke
of
venice
senator
we
are
very
sorry
for
t
duke
of
venice
[to
othello]
what
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
brabantio
nothing
but
this
is
so
othello
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
my
very
noble
and
approved
good
masters
that
i
have
ta
en
away
this
old
man
s
daughter
it
is
most
true
true
i
have
married
her
the
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
hath
this
extent
no
more
rude
am
i
in
my
speech
and
little
bless
d
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
for
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
used
their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
and
little
of
this
great
world
can
i
speak
more
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
and
therefore
little
shall
i
grace
my
cause
in
speaking
for
myself
yet
by
your
gracious
patience
i
will
a
round
unvarnish
d
tale
deliver
of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
what
conjuration
and
what
mighty
magic
for
such
proceeding
i
am
charged
withal
i
won
his
daughter
brabantio
a
maiden
never
bold
of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
blush
d
at
herself
and
she
in
spite
of
nature
of
years
of
country
credit
every
thing
to
fall
in
love
with
what
she
fear
d
to
look
on
it
is
a
judgment
maim
d
and
most
imperfect
that
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
to
find
out
practises
of
cunning
hell
why
this
should
be
i
therefore
vouch
again
that
with
some
mixtures
powerful
o
er
the
blood
or
with
some
dram
conjured
to
this
effect
he
wrought
upon
her
duke
of
venice
to
vouch
this
is
no
proof
without
more
wider
and
more
overt
test
than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
first
senator
but
othello
speak
did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
subdue
and
poison
this
young
maid
s
affections
or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
as
soul
to
soul
affordeth
othello
i
do
beseech
you
send
for
the
lady
to
the
sagittary
and
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
if
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
the
trust
the
office
i
do
hold
of
you
not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
even
fall
upon
my
life
duke
of
venice
fetch
desdemona
hither
othello
ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
exeunt
iago
and
attendants
and
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
i
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
so
justly
to
your
grave
ears
i
ll
present
how
i
did
thrive
in
this
fair
lady
s
love
and
she
in
mine
duke
of
venice
say
it
othello
othello
her
father
loved
me
oft
invited
me
still
question
d
me
the
story
of
my
life
from
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
that
i
have
passed
i
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
to
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
wherein
i
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
of
hair
breadth
scapes
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
and
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
and
portance
in
my
travels
history
wherein
of
antres
vast
and
deserts
idle
rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
it
was
my
hint
to
speak
such
was
the
process
and
of
the
cannibals
that
each
other
eat
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
this
to
hear
would
desdemona
seriously
incline
but
still
the
house
affairs
would
draw
her
thence
which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
she
ld
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
devour
up
my
discourse
which
i
observing
took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
to
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
that
i
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
but
not
intentively
i
did
consent
and
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
when
i
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
that
my
youth
suffer
d
my
story
being
done
she
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
she
swore
in
faith
twas
strange
twas
passing
strange
twas
pitiful
twas
wondrous
pitiful
she
wish
d
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
wish
d
that
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thank
d
me
and
bade
me
if
i
had
a
friend
that
loved
her
i
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
and
that
would
woo
her
upon
this
hint
i
spake
she
loved
me
for
the
dangers
i
had
pass
d
and
i
loved
her
that
she
did
pity
them
this
only
is
the
witchcraft
i
have
used
here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it
enter
desdemona
iago
and
attendants
duke
of
venice
i
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
good
brabantio
take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
than
their
bare
hands
brabantio
i
pray
you
hear
her
speak
if
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
light
on
the
man
come
hither
gentle
mistress
do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
where
most
you
owe
obedience
desdemona
my
noble
father
i
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
to
you
i
am
bound
for
life
and
education
my
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
how
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
i
am
hitherto
your
daughter
but
here
s
my
husband
and
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
show
d
to
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
so
much
i
challenge
that
i
may
profess
due
to
the
moor
my
lord
brabantio
god
be
wi
you
i
have
done
please
it
your
grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
i
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
come
hither
moor
i
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
i
would
keep
from
thee
for
your
sake
jewel
i
am
glad
at
soul
i
have
no
other
child
for
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
to
hang
clogs
on
them
i
have
done
my
lord
duke
of
venice
let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
which
as
a
grise
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
into
your
favour
when
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
by
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
to
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
what
cannot
be
preserved
when
fortune
takes
patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
the
robb
d
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
he
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
brabantio
so
let
the
turk
of
cyprus
us
beguile
we
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
he
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
but
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
but
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
that
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
these
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
but
words
are
words
i
never
yet
did
hear
that
the
bruised
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
i
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
duke
of
venice
the
turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
cyprus
othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
you
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
othello
the
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
my
thrice
driven
bed
of
down
i
do
agnise
a
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
i
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
these
present
wars
against
the
ottomites
most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
i
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
with
such
accommodation
and
besort
as
levels
with
her
breeding

t
at
her
father

brabantio
i

not
have
it
so
othello
nor
i
desdemona

i
would
not

put
my
father
in
impatient
thoughts
by
being
in
his
eye
most
gracious
duke
to
my
unfolding
lend
your
prosperous
ear
and
let
me
find
a
charter
in
your
voice
to
assist

simpleness

of
venice
what
would
you
desdemona
desdemona
that
i
did
love
the
moor
to
live
with
him
my
downright
violence
and
storm
of
fortunes
may
trumpet
to
the
world
my
heart
s
subdued
even
to
the
very
quality
of
my
lord
i
saw
othello
s
visage
in
his
mind
and
to
his
honour
and
his
valiant
parts
did
i
my
soul
and
fortunes
consecrate
so
that
dear
lords
if

a
moth
of
peace
and

to
the
war
the
rites
for
which

a
heavy
interim

his
dear
absence
let
me
go
with
him
othello
let
her
have
your
voices
vouch

therefore
beg

not
to

the
palate
of
my
appetite

to
comply
with

why
the
power
and

authority
of
this
lies
in
our

the

not
one
scale

another
of
sensuality
the

us
to

preposterous
conclusions
but
we
have
reason
to
cool
our
raging
motions
our
carnal
stings
our
unbitted
lusts
whereof
i
take
this
that
you
call
love
to
be
a
sect
or
scion
roderigo
it
cannot
be

it
is
merely
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
come
be
a
man
drown
thyself
drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
i
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
i
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
i
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
thou
the
wars
defeat
thy
favour
with
an
usurped
beard
i
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
it
cannot
be
that
desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
moor
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
it
was
a
violent
commencement
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
these
moors
are
changeable
in
their
wills
fill
thy
purse
with
money
the
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
bitter
as
coloquintida
she
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
she
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
if
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
make
all
the
money
thou
canst
if
sanctimony
and
a
frail
vow
betwixt
an
erring
barbarian
and
a
supersubtle
venetian
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the
tribe
of
hell
thou
shalt
enjoy
her
therefore
make
money
a
pox
of
drowning
thyself
it
is
clean
out
of
the
way
seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
roderigo
wilt
thou
be
fast
to
my
hopes
if
i
depend
on
the
issue
iago
thou
art
sure
of
me
go
make

i
have
told
thee
often
and
i

tell

my

thine

absolute

not
another
comfort
like

succeeds
in

fate

for
bragging
and
telling
her
fantastical
lies
and
will
she
love
him
still
for
prating
let
not
thy
discreet
heart
think
it
her
eye
must
be
fed
and
what
delight
shall
she
have
to
look
on
the
devil
when
the
blood
is
made
dull
with
the
act
of
sport
there
should
be
again
to
inflame
it
and
to
give
satiety
a
fresh
appetite
loveliness
in
favour
sympathy
in
years
manners
and
beauties
all
which
the
moor
is
defective
in
now
for
want
of
these
required
conveniences
her
delicate
tenderness
will
find
itself
abused
begin
to
heave
the
gorge
disrelish
and
abhor
the
moor
very
nature
will
instruct
her
in
it
and
compel
her
to
some
second
choice
now
sir
this
granted
as
it
is
a
most
pregnant
and
unforced
position
who
stands
so
eminent
in
the
degree
of
this
fortune
as
cassio
does
a
knave
very
voluble
no
further
conscionable
than
in
putting
on
the
mere
form
of
civil
and
humane
seeming
for
the
better
compassing
of
his
salt
and
most
hidden
loose
affection
why
none
why
none
a
slipper
and
subtle
knave
a
finder
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
present
itself
a
devilish
knave
besides
the
knave
is
handsome
young
and
hath
all
those
requisites
in
him
that
folly
and
green
minds
look
after
a
pestilent
complete
knave
and
the
woman
hath
found
him
already
roderigo
i
cannot
believe
that
in
her
she
s
full
of
most
blessed
condition
iago
blessed
fig
s
end
the
wine
she
drinks
is
made
of
grapes
if
she
had
been
blessed
she
would
never
have
loved
the
moor
blessed
pudding
didst
thou
not
see
her
paddle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
didst
not
mark
that
roderigo
yes
that
i
did
but
that
was
but
courtesy
iago
lechery
by
this
hand
an
index
and
obscure
prologue
to
the
history
of
lust
and
foul
thoughts
they
met
so
near
with
their
lips
that
their
breaths
embraced
together
villanous
thoughts
roderigo
when
these
mutualities
so
marshal
the
way
hard
at
hand
comes
the
master
and
main
exercise
the
incorporate
conclusion
pish
but
sir
be
you
ruled
by
me
i
have
brought
you
from
venice
watch
you
to
night
for
the
command
i
ll
lay
t
upon
you
cassio
knows
you
not
i
ll
not
be
far
from
you
do
you
find
some
occasion
to
anger
cassio
either
by
speaking
too
loud
or
tainting
his
discipline
or
from
what
other
course
you
please
which
the
time
shall
more
favourably
minister
roderigo
well
iago
sir
he
is
rash
and
very
sudden
in
choler
and
haply
may
strike
at
you
provoke
him
that
he
may
for
even
out
of
that
will
i
cause
these
of
cyprus
to
mutiny
whose
qualification
shall
come
into
no
true
taste
again
but
by
the
displanting
of
cassio
so
shall
you
have
a
shorter
journey
to
your
desires
by
the
means
i
shall
then
have
to
prefer
them
and
the
impediment
most
profitably
removed
without
the
which
there
were
no
expectation
of
our
prosperity
roderigo
i
will
do
this
if
i
can
bring
it
to
any
opportunity
iago
i
warrant
thee
meet
me
by
and
by
at
the
citadel
i
must
fetch
his
necessaries
ashore
farewell
roderigo
adieu
exit
iago
that
cassio
loves
her
i
do
well
believe
it
that
she
loves
him
tis
apt
and
of
great
credit
the
moor
howbeit
that
i
endure
him
not
is
of
a
constant
loving
noble
nature
and
i
dare
think
he
ll
prove
to
desdemona
a
most
dear
husband
now
i
do
love
her
too
not
out
of
absolute
lust
though
peradventure
i
stand
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
but
partly
led
to
diet
my
revenge
for
that
i
do
suspect
the
lusty
moor
hath
leap
d
into
my
seat
the
thought
whereof
doth
like
a
poisonous
mineral
gnaw
my
inwards
and
nothing
can
or
shall
content
my
soul
till
i
am
even
d
with
him
wife
for
wife
or
failing
so
yet
that
i
put
the
moor
at
least
into
a
jealousy
so
strong
that
judgment
cannot
cure
which
thing
to
do
if
this
poor
trash
of
venice
whom
i
trash
for
his
quick
hunting
stand

putting

ll
have
our
michael

i
fear
cassio
with
my
night
cap

make
the

thank
me
love
me
and
reward
me
for
making

egregiously
an
ass

cassio
indeed
she

fresh

delicate

methinks
it
sounds
a
parley
of
provocation
cassio
an
inviting
eye

methinks
right
modest
iago
and
when

i
hold
him
to
be
unworthy

that
is
gone
before

see
his
vice
tis
to
his
virtue
a
just
equinox
the
one
as
long
as
the
other
tis
pity
of
him
i
fear
the
trust
othello
puts
him
in
on
some
odd
time
of
his
infirmity
will
shake
this
island
montano
but
is

worthy

you

the
gravity

stillness
of
your
youth
the
world
hath
noted
and
your
name
is
great
in
mouths
of
wisest
censure
what
s
the
matter
that
you
unlace
your
reputation
thus
and
spend
your
rich
opinion
for
the
name
of
a
night
brawler
give
me
answer
to
it
montano
worthy
othello
i
am
hurt
to
danger
your
officer
iago
can
inform
you
while
i
spare

which
something
now
offends
me
of
all
that
i
do
know
nor
know
i
aught
by
me
that
s
said
or
done
amiss
this
night
unless
self
charity
be
sometimes
a
vice
and
to
defend
ourselves
it
be
a
sin
when
violence
assails
us
othello
now
by
heaven
my
blood
begins
my
safer
guides
to

and

having
my
best
judgment
collied

if
i
once
stir

lift
this

the
best
of
you
shall
sink
in
my
rebuke
give
me
to
know
how
this
foul
rout
began
who
set
it
on
and
he
that
is
approved
in
this
offence
though
he
had
twinn
d
with
me
both
at

birth
shall
lose
me
what
in

hearts
brimful
of
fear
to
manage
private
and
domestic
quarrel
in

and
on
the
court
and

of

tis
monstrous
iago
who
began

if
partially
affined
or
leagued
in
office
thou
dost
deliver
more
or
less
than
truth
thou
art
no
soldier
iago
touch
me
not
so
near
i
had
rather
have
this
tongue
cut
from
my
mouth
than
it
should
do
offence
to
michael
cassio
yet
i
persuade
myself
to
speak
the
truth
shall
nothing
wrong
him
thus
it
is
general
montano
and
myself
being
in
speech
there
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for
help
and
cassio
following
him
with
determined
sword
to
execute
upon
him
sir
this
gentleman
steps
in
to
cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
myself
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
lest
by
his
clamour
as
it
so
fell
out
the
town
might
fall
in
fright
he
swift
of
foot
outran
my
purpose
and
i
return
d
the
rather
for
that
i
heard
the
clink
and
fall
of
swords
and
cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
to
night
i
ne
er
might
say
before
when
i
came
back
for
this
was
brief
i
found
them
close
together
at
blow
and
thrust
even
as
again
they
were
when
you
yourself
did
part
them
more
of
this
matter
cannot
i
report
but
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
though
cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
as
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
yet
surely
cassio
i
believe
received
from
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignity
which
patience
could
not
pass
othello
i
know
iago
thy
honesty
and
love
doth
mince
this
matter
making
it
light
to
cassio
cassio

if
my

othello
all

iago
what
are
you

ay
past

reputation
reputation
reputation
o
i
have
lost
my
reputation
i
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
myself
and
what
remains
is
bestial
my
reputation
iago
my
reputation
iago
as
i
am
an
honest
man
i
thought
you
had
received
some
bodily
wound
there
is
more
sense
in
that
than
in
reputation
reputation
is
an
idle
and
most
false
imposition
oft
got
without
merit
and
lost
without
deserving
you
have
lost
no
reputation
at
all
unless
you
repute
yourself
such
a
loser
what
man
there
are
ways
to
recover
the
general
again
you
are
but
now
cast
in
his
mood
a
punishment
more
in
policy
than
in
malice
even
so
as
one
would
beat
his
offenceless
dog
to
affright
an
imperious
lion
sue
to
him
again
and
he
s
yours
cassio
i
will
rather
sue
to
be
despised
than
to
deceive
so
good
a
commander
with
so
slight
so
drunken
and
so
indiscreet
an
officer
drunk
and
speak
parrot
and
squabble
swagger
swear
and
discourse
fustian
with
one
s
own
shadow
o
thou
invisible
spirit
of
wine
if
thou
hast
no
name
to
be
known
by
let
us
call
thee
devil
iago
what
was
he
that
you
followed
with
your
sword
what
had
he
done
to
you
cassio
i
know
not
iago
is
t
possible
cassio
i
remember
a
mass
of
things
but
nothing
distinctly
a
quarrel
but
nothing
wherefore
o
god
that
men
should
put
an
enemy
in
their
mouths
to
steal
away
their
brains
that
we
should
with
joy
pleasance
revel
and
applause
transform
ourselves
into
beasts
iago
why
but
you
are
now
well
enough
how
came
you
thus
recovered
cassio
it
hath
pleased
the
devil
drunkenness
to
give
place
to
the
devil
wrath
one
unperfectness
shows
me
another
to
make
me
frankly
despise
myself
iago
come
you
are
too
severe
a
moraler
as
the
time
the
place
and
the
condition
of
this
country
stands
i
could
heartily
wish
this
had
not
befallen
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
mend
it
for
your
own
good
cassio
i
will
ask
him
for
my
place
again
he
shall
tell
me
i
am
a
drunkard
had
i
as
many
mouths
as
hydra
such
an
answer
would
stop
them
all
to
be
now
a
sensible
man
by
and
by
a
fool
and
presently
a
beast
o
strange
every
inordinate
cup
is
unblessed
and
the
ingredient
is
a
devil
iago
come
come
good
wine
is
a
good
familiar
creature
if
it
be
well
used
exclaim
no
more
against
it
and
good
lieutenant

i

tell
you
what
you
shall
do
our
general
s
wife
is
now
the
general
may
say
so
in
this
respect
for
that
he
hath
devoted
and
given
up
himself
to
the
contemplation
mark
and
denotement
of
her
parts
and
graces
confess
yourself
freely
to
her
importune
her
help
to
put
you
in
your
place
again
she
is
of
so
free
so
kind
so
apt
so
blessed
a
disposition
she
holds
it
a
vice
in
her
goodness
not
to
do
more
than
she
is
requested
this
broken
joint
between
you
and
her
husband
entreat
her
to
splinter
and
my
fortunes
against
any
lay
worth
naming
this
crack
of
your
love
shall
grow
stronger
than
it
was
before
cassio
you
advise
me
well
iago
i
protest
in
the
sincerity
of
love
and
honest
kindness
cassio
i
think
it
freely
and
betimes
in
the
morning
i
will
beseech
the
virtuous
desdemona
to
undertake
for
me
i
am
desperate
of
my
fortunes
if
they
cheque
me
here
iago
you
are
in
the
right
good
night
lieutenant
i
must
to
the
watch
cassio
good
night
honest
iago
exit
iago
and
what
s
he
then
that
says
i
play
the
villain
when
this
advice
is
free
i
give
and
honest
probal
to
thinking
and
indeed
the
course
to
win
the
moor
again
for
tis
most
easy
the
inclining
desdemona
to
subdue
in
any
honest
suit
she
s
framed
as
fruitful
as
the
free
elements
and
then
for
her
to
win
the
moor
were
t
to
renounce
his
baptism
all
seals
and
symbols
of
redeemed
sin
his
soul
is
so
enfetter
d
to
her
love
that
she
may
make
unmake
do
what
she
list
even
as
her
appetite
shall
play
the
god
with
his
weak
function
how
am
i
then
a
villain
to
counsel
cassio
to
this
parallel
course
directly
to
his
good
divinity
of
hell
when
devils
will
the
blackest
sins
put
on
they
do
suggest
at
first
with
heavenly
shows
as
i
do
now
for
whiles
this
honest
fool
plies
desdemona
to
repair
his
fortunes
and
she
for
him
pleads
strongly
to
the
moor
i
ll
pour
this
pestilence
into
his
ear
that
she
repeals
him
for
her
body
s
lust
and
by
how
much
she
strives
to
do
him
good
she
shall
undo
her
credit
with
the
moor
so
will
i
turn
her
virtue
into
pitch
and
out
of
her
own
goodness
make
the
net
that
shall
enmesh
them
all

now
roderigo

do
follow

you
that
errs
in
ignorance

not
in
cunning
i
have
no
judgment
in
an
honest
face
i
prithee
call
him
back
othello
went
he
hence
now
desdemona
ay
sooth
so
humbled
that
he
hath
left
part

with
me
to

call
him
back

let
it
not

he

penitent
and
yet
his
trespass
in
our
common
reason
save
that
they
say
the
wars
must
make
examples
out
of
their
best
is
not
almost
a
fault
to
incur
a
private
cheque
when
shall
he
come
tell
me
othello
i
wonder
in
my
soul
what
you
would
ask
me
that

should
deny
or
stand
so
mammering
on
what
michael
cassio
that

your

when
he
will
i
will
deny
thee
nothing
desdemona
why
this
is
not
a
boon

as
i
should
entreat
you

your
gloves
or
feed
on
nourishing
dishes
or
keep
you
warm
or
sue
to
you
to

a
peculiar
profit
to
your
own
person
nay
when

have
a
suit
wherein
i
mean
to
touch
your
love
indeed
it
shall
be
full
of
poise
and
difficult
weight
and
fearful
to
be
granted
othello
i
will
deny
thee
nothing
whereon
i
do
beseech
thee
grant
me
this
to
leave
me
but
a
little
to
myself

shall
i
deny
you
no
farewell

lord

desdemona

ll
come
to
thee
straight

as
your
fancies
teach

whate
er

i
am
obedient
exeunt
desdemona
and
emilia
othello
excellent
wretch
perdition
catch
my
soul
but
i
do
love
thee
and
when
i
love
thee
not
chaos
is
come
again
iago
my
noble
lord
othello
what
dost
thou
say
iago
iago
did
michael
cassio
when
you
woo
d
my
lady
know
of
your
love
othello
he
did
from
first
to
last
why
dost
thou
ask
iago
but
for
a
satisfaction
of
my
thought
no
further
harm
othello
why
of
thy
thought
iago
iago
i
did
not
think
he
had
been
acquainted
with
her
othello
o
yes
and
went
between
us
very
oft
iago
indeed
othello
indeed
ay
indeed
discern
st
thou
aught
in
that
is
he
not
honest
iago
honest
my
lord
othello
honest
ay
honest
iago
my
lord
for
aught
i
know
othello
what
dost
thou
think
iago
think
my
lord
othello
think
my
lord
by
heaven
he
echoes
me
as
if
there
were
some
monster
in
his
thought
too
hideous
to
be
shown
thou
dost
mean
something
i
heard
thee
say
even
now
thou
likedst
not
that
when
cassio
left
my
wife
what
didst
not
like
and
when
i
told
thee
he
was
of
my
counsel
in
my
whole
course
of
wooing
thou
criedst
indeed
and
didst
contract
and
purse
thy
brow
together
as
if
thou
then
hadst
shut
up
in
thy
brain
some
horrible
conceit
if
thou
dost
love
me
show
me
thy
thought
iago
my
lord
you
know
i
love
you
othello
i
think
thou
dost
and
for
i
know
thou
rt
full
of
love
and
honesty
and
weigh
st
thy
words
before
thou
givest
them
breath
therefore
these
stops
of
thine
fright
me
the
more
for
such
things
in
a
false
disloyal
knave
are
tricks
of
custom
but
in
a
man
that
s
just
they
are
close
delations
working
from
the
heart
that
passion
cannot
rule
iago
for
michael
cassio
i
dare
be
sworn
i
think
that
he
is
honest
othello
i
think
so
too
iago
men
should
be
what
they
seem
or
those
that
be
not
would
they
might
seem
none
othello
certain
men
should
be
what
they
seem
iago
why
then
i
think
cassio
s
an
honest
man
othello
nay
yet
there
s
more
in
this
i
prithee
speak
to
me
as
to
thy
thinkings
as
thou
dost
ruminate
and
give
thy
worst
of
thoughts
the
worst
of
words
iago
good
my
lord
pardon
me
though
i
am
bound
to
every
act
of
duty
i
am
not
bound
to
that
all
slaves
are
free
to
utter
my
thoughts
why
say
they
are
vile
and
false
as
where
s
that
palace
whereinto
foul
things
sometimes
intrude
not
who
has
a
breast
so
pure
but
some
uncleanly
apprehensions
keep
leets
and
law
days
and
in
session
sit
with
meditations
lawful
othello
thou
dost
conspire
against
thy
friend
iago
if
thou
but
think
st
him
wrong
d
and
makest
his
ear
a
stranger
to
thy
thoughts
iago
i
do
beseech
you
though
i
perchance
am
vicious
in
my
guess
as
i
confess
it
is
my
nature
s
plague
to
spy
into
abuses
and
oft
my
jealousy
shapes
faults
that
are
not
that
your
wisdom
yet
from
one
that
so
imperfectly
conceits
would
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
it
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
to
let
you
know
my
thoughts
othello
what
dost
thou
mean
iago
good
name
in
man
and
woman
dear
my
lord
is
the
immediate
jewel
of
their
souls
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
tis
something
nothing
twas
mine
tis
his
and
has
been
slave
to
thousands
but
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
robs
me
of
that
which
not
enriches
him
and
makes
me
poor
indeed
othello
by
heaven
i
ll
know
thy
thoughts
iago
you
cannot
if
my
heart
were
in
your
hand
nor
shall
not
whilst
tis
in
my
custody
othello
ha
iago
o
beware
my
lord
of
jealousy
it
is
the
green
eyed
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
that
cuckold
lives
in
bliss
who
certain
of
his
fate
loves
not
his
wronger
but
o
what
damned
minutes
tells
he
o
er
who
dotes
yet
doubts
suspects
yet
strongly
loves
othello
o
misery
iago
poor
and
content
is
rich
and
rich
enough
but
riches
fineless
is
as
poor
as
winter
to
him
that
ever
fears
he
shall
be
poor
good
heaven
the
souls
of
all
my
tribe
defend
from
jealousy
othello
why
why
is
this
think
st
thou
i
ld
make
a
lie
of
jealousy
to
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
with
fresh
suspicions
no
to
be
once
in
doubt
is
once
to
be
resolved
exchange
me
for
a
goat
when
i
shall
turn
the
business
of
my
soul
to
such
exsufflicate
and
blown
surmises
matching
thy
inference
tis
not
to
make
me
jealous
to
say
my
wife
is
fair
feeds
well
loves
company
is
free
of
speech
sings
plays
and
dances
well
where
virtue
is
these
are
more
virtuous
nor
from
mine
own
weak
merits
will
i
draw
the
smallest
fear
or
doubt
of
her
revolt
for
she
had
eyes
and
chose
me
no
iago
i
ll
see
before
i
doubt
when
i
doubt
prove
and
on
the
proof
there
is
no
more
but
this
away
at
once
with
love
or
jealousy
iago
i
am
glad
of
it
for
now
i
shall
have
reason
to
show
the
love
and
duty
that
i
bear
you
with
franker
spirit
therefore
as
i
am
bound
receive
it
from
me
i
speak
not
yet
of
proof
look
to
your
wife
observe
her
well
with
cassio
wear
your
eye
thus
not
jealous
nor
secure
i
would
not
have
your
free
and
noble
nature
out
of
self
bounty
be
abused
look
to
t
i
know
our
country
disposition
well
in
venice
they
do
let
heaven
see
the
pranks
they
dare
not
show
their
husbands
their
best
conscience
is
not
to
leave
t
undone
but
keep
t
unknown
othello
dost
thou
say
so
iago
she
did
deceive
her
father
marrying
you
and
when
she
seem
d
to
shake
and
fear
your
looks
she
loved
them
most
othello
and
so
she
did
iago
why
go
to
then
she
that
so
young
could
give
out
such
a
seeming
to
seal
her
father
s
eyes
up
close
as
oak
he
thought
twas
witchcraft
but
i
am
much
to
blame
i
humbly
do
beseech
you
of
your
pardon
for
too
much
loving
you
othello
i
am
bound
to
thee
for
ever
iago
i
see
this
hath
a
little
dash
d
your
spirits
othello
not
a
jot
not
a
jot
iago
i
faith
i
fear
it
has
i
hope
you
will
consider
what
is
spoke
comes
from
my
love
but
i
do
see
you
re
moved
i
am
to
pray
you
not
to
strain
my
speech
to
grosser
issues
nor
to
larger
reach
than
to
suspicion
othello
i
will
not
iago
should
you
do
so
my
lord
my
speech
should
fall
into
such
vile
success
as
my
thoughts
aim
not
at
cassio
s
my
worthy
friend
my
lord
i
see
you
re
moved
othello
no
not
much
moved
i
do
not
think
but
desdemona
s
honest
iago
long
live
she
so
and
long
live
you
to
think
so
othello
and
yet
how
nature
erring
from
itself
iago
ay
there
s
the
point
as
to
be
bold
with
you
not
to
affect
many
proposed
matches
of
her
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
whereto
we
see
in
all
things
nature
tends
foh
one
may
smell
in
such
a
will
most
rank
foul
disproportion
thoughts
unnatural
but
pardon
me
i
do
not
in
position
distinctly
speak
of
her
though
i
may
fear
her
will
recoiling
to
her
better
judgment
may
fall
to
match
you
with
her
country
forms
and
happily
repent
othello
farewell
farewell
if
more
thou
dost
perceive
let
me
know
more
set
on
thy
wife
to
observe
leave
me
iago
iago
[going]
my
lord
i
take
my
leave
othello
why
did
i
marry
this
honest
creature
doubtless
sees
and
knows
more
much
more
than
he
unfolds
iago
[returning]
my
lord
i
would
i
might
entreat
your
honour
to
scan
this
thing
no
further
leave
it
to
time
though
it
be
fit
that
cassio
have
his
place
for
sure
he
fills
it
up
with
great
ability
yet
if
you
please
to
hold
him
off
awhile
you
shall
by
that
perceive
him
and
his
means
note
if
your
lady
strain
his
entertainment
with
any
strong
or
vehement
importunity
much
will
be
seen
in
that
in
the
mean
time
let
me
be
thought
too
busy
in
my
fears
as
worthy
cause
i
have
to
fear
i
am
and
hold
her
free
i
do
beseech
your
honour
othello
fear
not
my
government
iago
i
once
more
take
my
leave
exit
othello
this
fellow
s
of
exceeding
honesty
and
knows
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
of
human
dealings
if
i
do
prove
her
haggard
though
that
her
jesses
were
my
dear
heartstrings
i
ld
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
to
pray
at
fortune
haply
for
i
am
black
and
have
not
those
soft
parts
of
conversation
that
chamberers
have
or
for
i
am
declined
into
the
vale
of
years
yet
that
s
not
much
she
s
gone
i
am
abused
and
my
relief
must
be
to
loathe
her
o
curse
of
marriage
that
we
can
call
these
delicate
creatures
ours
and
not
their
appetites
i
had
rather
be
a
toad
and
live
upon
the
vapour
of
a
dungeon
than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
i
love
for
others
uses
yet
tis
the
plague
of
great
ones
prerogatived
are
they
less
than
the
base
tis
destiny
unshunnable
like
death
even
then
this
forked
plague
is
fated
to
us
when
we
do
quicken
desdemona
comes
re
enter
desdemona
and
emilia
if
she
be
false
o
then
heaven
mocks
itself
i
ll
not
believe
t
desdemona
how
now
my
dear
othello
your
dinner
and
the
generous
islanders
by
you
invited
do
attend
your
presence
othello
i
am
to
blame
desdemona
why
do
you
speak
so
faintly
are
you
not
well
othello
i
have
a
pain
upon
my
forehead
here
desdemona
faith
that
s
with
watching
twill
away
again
let
me
but
bind
it
hard
within
this
hour
it
will
be
well
othello
your
napkin
is
too
little

puts
the
handkerchief
from
him
and
it
drops
let
it
alone
come
i
ll
go
in
with
you
desdemona
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
not
well
exeunt
othello
and
desdemona
emilia
i
am
glad
i
have
found
this
napkin
this
was
her
first
remembrance
from
the
moor
my
wayward
husband
hath
a
hundred
times
woo
d
me
to
steal
it
but
she
so
loves
the
token
for
he
conjured
her
she
should
ever
keep
it
that
she
reserves
it
evermore
about
her
to
kiss
and
talk
to
i
ll
have
the
work
ta
en
out
and
give
t
iago
what
he
will
do
with
it
heaven
knows
not
i
i
nothing
but
to
please
his
fantasy
re
enter
iago
iago
how
now
what
do
you
here

emilia
do
not

have
a
thing
for
you

thing
for
me

is
a
common
thing
emilia
ha
iago
to
have
a
foolish
wife
emilia
o
is
that
all
what
will
you
give
me
now
for
the
same
handkerchief
iago
what
handkerchief
emilia
what
handkerchief
why
that
the
moor
first
gave
to
desdemona
that
which
so
often
you
did
bid
me
steal
iago
hast
stol
n
it
from
her
emilia
no
faith

negligence
and

let
him
find

trifles
light
as

to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
as
proofs
of
holy
writ
this
may
do
something
the
moor
already
changes
with
my
poison
dangerous
conceits
are
in
their
natures
poisons
which
at
the
first
are
scarce
found
to
distaste
but
with
a
little
act
upon
the
blood
burn
like
the
mines
of
sulphur
i
did
say
so
look
where
he
comes
re
enter
othello
not
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
shall

thou
hast
set
me
on
the
rack

swear
tis
better
to
be
much
abused
than
but
to
know
t
a
little
iago
how
now
my
lord
othello
what
sense
had
i
of
her
stol
n
hours
of
lust

or
sense
god
be
wi
you
take
mine
office
o
wretched
fool
that
livest
to
make
thine
honesty
a
vice
o
monstrous
world
take
note
take
note
o
world
to
be
direct
and
honest
is
not
safe
i
thank
you
for
this
profit
and
from
hence
i
ll
love
no
friend
sith
love
breeds
such
offence
othello
nay
stay
thou
shouldst
be
honest
iago
i
should
be
wise
for
honesty
s
a
fool
and
loses
that
it
works
for
othello
by
the
world
i
think
my
wife
be
honest
and
think
she
is
not
i
think
that
thou
art
just
and
think
thou
art
not
i
ll
have
some
proof
her
name
that
was
as
fresh
as
dian
s
visage
is
now
begrimed
and
black
as
mine
own
face
if
there
be
cords
or
knives
poison
or
fire
or
suffocating
streams
i
ll
not
endure
it
would
i
were
satisfied
iago
i
see
sir
you
are
eaten
up
with
passion
i
do
repent
me
that
i
put
it
to
you
you
would
be
satisfied
othello
would
nay
i
will
iago
and
may
but
how
how
satisfied
my
lord
would
you
the
supervisor
grossly
gape
on
behold
her
topp
d
othello
death
and
damnation
o
iago
it
were
a
tedious
difficulty
i
think
to
bring
them
to
that
prospect
damn
them
then
if
ever
mortal
eyes
do
see
them
bolster
more
than
their
own
what
then
how
then
what
shall
i
say
where
s
satisfaction
it
is
impossible
you
should
see
this
were
they
as
prime
as
goats
as
hot
as
monkeys
as
salt
as
wolves
in
pride
and
fools
as
gross
as
ignorance
made
drunk
but
yet
i
say
if
imputation
and
strong
circumstances
which
lead
directly
to
the
door
of
truth
will
give
you
satisfaction
you
may
have
t
othello
give
me
a
living
reason
she
s
disloyal
iago
i
do
not
like
the
office
but
sith
i
am
enter
d
in
this
cause
so
far
prick
d
to
t
by
foolish
honesty
and
love
i
will
go
on
i
lay
with
cassio
lately
and
being
troubled
with
a
raging
tooth
i
could
not
sleep
there
are
a
kind
of
men
so
loose
of
soul
that
in
their
sleeps
will
mutter
their
affairs
one
of
this
kind
is
cassio
in
sleep
i
heard
him
say
sweet
desdemona
let
us
be
wary
let
us
hide
our
loves
and
then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my
hand
cry
o
sweet
creature
and
then
kiss
me
hard
as
if
he
pluck
d
up
kisses
by
the
roots
that
grew
upon
my
lips
then
laid
his
leg
over
my
thigh
and
sigh
d
and
kiss
d
and
then
cried
cursed
fate
that
gave
thee
to
the
moor
othello
o
monstrous
monstrous
iago
nay
this
was
but
his
dream
othello
but
this
denoted
a
foregone
conclusion
tis
a
shrewd
doubt
though
it
be
but
a
dream
iago
and
this
may
help
to
thicken
other
proofs
that
do
demonstrate
thinly
othello
i
ll
tear
her
all
to
pieces
iago
nay
but
be
wise
yet
we
see
nothing
done
she
may
be
honest
yet
tell
me
but
this
have
you
not
sometimes
seen
a
handkerchief
spotted
with
strawberries
in
your
wife
s
hand
othello
i
gave
her
such
a
one
twas
my
first
gift
iago
i
know
not
that
but
such
a
handkerchief
i
am
sure
it
was
your
wife
s
did
i
to
day
see
cassio
wipe
his
beard
with
othello
if
it
be
that
iago
if
it
be
that
or
any
that
was
hers
it
speaks
against
her
with
the
other
proofs
othello
o
that
the
slave
had
forty
thousand
lives
one
is
too
poor
too
weak
for
my
revenge
now
do
i
see
tis
true
look
here
iago
all
my
fond
love
thus
do
i
blow
to
heaven
tis
gone
arise
black
vengeance
from
thy
hollow
cell
yield
up
o
love
thy
crown
and
hearted
throne
to
tyrannous
hate
swell
bosom
with
thy
fraught
for
tis
of
aspics
tongues
iago
yet
be
content
othello
o
blood
blood
blood
iago
patience
i
say
your
mind
perhaps
may
change
othello
never
iago
like
to
the
pontic
sea
whose
icy
current
and
compulsive
course
ne
er
feels
retiring
ebb
but
keeps
due
on
to
the
propontic
and
the
hellespont
even
so
my
bloody
thoughts
with
violent
pace
shall
ne
er
look
back
ne
er
ebb
to
humble
love
till
that
a
capable
and
wide
revenge
swallow
them
up
now
by
yond
marble
heaven
kneels
in
the
due
reverence
of
a
sacred
vow
i
here
engage
my
words
iago
do
not
rise
yet
kneels
witness
you
ever
burning
lights
above
you
elements
that
clip
us
round
about
witness
that
here
iago
doth
give
up
the
execution
of
his
wit
hands
heart
to
wrong
d
othello
s
service
let
him
command
and
to
obey
shall
be
in
me
remorse
what
bloody
business
ever
they
rise
othello
i
greet
thy
love
not
with
vain
thanks
but
with
acceptance
bounteous
and
will
upon
the
instant
put
thee
to
t
within
these
three
days
let
me
hear
thee
say
that
cassio
s
not
alive
iago
my
friend
is
dead
tis
done
at
your
request
but
let
her
live
othello
damn
her
lewd
minx
o
damn
her
come
go
with
me
apart
i
will
withdraw
to
furnish

with
some
swift
means

i
dare
not
say
he
lies
any
where
desdemona
why
man
clown
he
s
a
soldier
and
for
one
to
say
a
soldier
lies
is
stabbing
desdemona
go
to
where
lodges
he
clown
to
tell
you
where
he
lodges
is
to
tell
you
where
i
lie
desdemona
can
any
thing
be
made
of
this
clown
i
know
not
where
he
lodges
and
for

to
devise
a
lodging
and
say
he
lies
here
or
he
lies
there
were
to
lie
in
mine
own
throat
desdemona
can
you

i
have
moved
my
lord
on
his
behalf
and
hope
all
will
be
well
clown
to
do
this
is
within
the
compass
of
man
s
wit
and
therefore
i
will
attempt
the
doing
it
exit
desdemona
where
should
i
lose
that
handkerchief
emilia
emilia
i
know
not
madam
desdemona
believe
me
i
had
rather
have
lost
my
purse
full
of
crusadoes
and
but
my
noble
moor
is
true
of
mind
and
made
of
no
such
baseness
as
jealous
creatures
are
it
were
enough
to
put
him
to
ill
thinking
emilia
is
he
not
jealous
desdemona
who
he
i
think
the
sun
where
he
was
born
drew
all
such
humours
from
him
emilia
look
where
he
comes
desdemona
i
will
not
leave
him
now
till
cassio
be
call
d
to
him
enter
othello
how
is
t
with
you
my
lord
othello
well
my
good
lady
aside
o
hardness
to
dissemble
how
do
you
desdemona
desdemona
well
my
good
lord
othello
give
me
your
hand
this
hand
is
moist
my
lady
desdemona
it
yet
hath
felt
no
age
nor
known
no
sorrow
othello
this
argues
fruitfulness
and
liberal
heart
hot
hot
and
moist
this
hand
of
yours
requires
a
sequester
from
liberty
fasting
and
prayer
much
castigation
exercise
devout
for
here
s
a
young
and
sweating
devil
here
that
commonly
rebels
tis
a
good
hand
a
frank
one
desdemona
you
may
indeed
say
so
for
twas
that
hand
that
gave
away
my
heart
othello
a
liberal
hand
the
hearts
of
old
gave
hands
but
our
new
heraldry
is
hands
not
hearts
desdemona
i
cannot
speak
of
this
come
now
your
promise
othello
what
promise
chuck
desdemona
i
have
sent
to
bid
cassio
come
speak
with
you
othello
i
have
a
salt
and
sorry
rheum
offends
me
lend
me
thy
handkerchief
desdemona
here
my
lord
othello
that
which
i
gave
you
desdemona
i
have
it
not
about
me
othello
not
desdemona
no
indeed
my
lord
othello
that
is
a
fault
that
handkerchief
did
an
egyptian
to
my
mother
give
she
was
a
charmer
and
could
almost
read
the
thoughts
of
people
she
told
her
while
she
kept
it
twould
make
her
amiable
and
subdue
my
father
entirely
to
her
love
but
if
she
lost
it
or
made
gift
of
it
my
father
s
eye
should
hold
her
loathed
and
his
spirits
should
hunt
after
new
fancies
she
dying
gave
it
me
and
bid
me
when
my
fate
would
have
me
wive
to
give
it
her
i
did
so
and
take
heed
on
t
make
it
a
darling
like
your
precious
eye
to
lose
t
or
give
t
away
were
such
perdition
as
nothing
else
could
match
desdemona
is
t
possible
othello
tis
true
there
s
magic
in
the
web
of
it
a
sibyl
that
had
number
d
in

sun
to
course
two
hundred
compasses
in
her
prophetic
fury
sew
d
the
work
the
worms
were
hallow
d
that
did
breed
the
silk
and
it
was
dyed
in
mummy
which
the
skilful
conserved
of
maidens
hearts
desdemona

is
t
true
othello
most
veritable
therefore

i
am
most
unhappy
in
the
loss
of
it
emilia
tis
not
a
year
or
two
shows
us
a
man
they
are
all
but
stomachs
and
we
all
but
food
to
eat
us
hungerly
and
when
they
are
full
they
belch

look
you
cassio
and
my
husband
enter
cassio
and
iago
iago
there
is
no
other
way

importune
her
desdemona
how
now
good
cassio
what
s
the
news
with
you
cassio
madam
my
former
suit
i
do
beseech
you
that
by
your
virtuous
means
i
may
again
exist
and
be
a
member
of
his
love
whom
i
with
all
the
office
of
my
heart
entirely
honour
i
would
not
be
delay
d
if
my
offence
be
of
such
mortal
kind
that
nor
my
service
past
nor
present
sorrows
nor
purposed
merit
in
futurity
can
ransom
me
into
his
love
again
but
to
know
so
must
be
my
benefit
so
shall
i
clothe
me
in
a
forced
content
and
shut
myself
up
in
some
other
course
to
fortune
s
alms
desdemona
alas
thrice
gentle
cassio
my
advocation
is
not
now
in
tune
my
lord
is
not
my
lord
nor
should
i
know
him
were
he
in
favour
as
in
humour
alter
d
so
help
me
every
spirit
sanctified
as
i
have
spoken
for
you
all
my
best
and
stood
within
the
blank
of
his
displeasure
for
my
free
speech
you
must
awhile
be
patient
what
i
can
do
i
will
and
more
i
will
than
for
myself
i
dare
let
that
suffice
you
iago
is
my
lord
angry
emilia
he
went
hence
but
now
and
certainly
in
strange
unquietness
iago
can
he
be
angry
i
have
seen
the
cannon
when
it
hath
blown
his
ranks
into
the
air
and
like
the
devil
from
his
very
arm
puff
d
his
own
brother
and
can
he
be
angry
something
of
moment
then
i
will
go
meet
him
there
s
matter
in
t
indeed
if
he
be
angry
desdemona
i
prithee
do
so
exit
iago
something
sure
of
state
either
from
venice
or
some
unhatch
d
practise
made
demonstrable
here
in
cyprus
to
him
hath
puddled
his
clear
spirit
and
in
such
cases
men
s
natures
wrangle
with
inferior
things
though
great
ones
are
their
object
tis
even
so
for
let
our
finger
ache
and
it
indues
our
other
healthful
members
even
to
that
sense
of
pain
nay
we
must
think
men
are
not
gods
nor
of
them
look
for
such
observances
as
fit
the
bridal
beshrew
me
much
emilia
i
was
unhandsome
warrior
as
i
am
arraigning
his
unkindness
with
my
soul

now
i
find
i
had
suborn
d
the
witness
and
he
s
indicted
falsely
emilia
pray
heaven
it
be
state
matters
as
you
think
and
no
conception
nor
no
jealous
toy
concerning
you
desdemona
alas
the
day
i
never
gave
him
cause
emilia
but
jealous
souls
will
not
be
answer
d
so
they
are
not
ever
jealous
for
the
cause
but
jealous
for
they
are
jealous
tis

monster
begot
upon

you
think
so
othello
think
so
iago
iago
what
to
kiss
in
private
othello
an
unauthorized
kiss
iago
or
to
be
naked
with
her
friend
in
bed
an
hour
or
more
not
meaning
any
harm
othello
naked
in
bed
iago
and
not
mean
harm
it
is
hypocrisy
against
the
devil
they
that
mean
virtuously
and
yet
do
so
the
devil
their
virtue
tempts
and
they
tempt
heaven
iago
so
they
do
nothing
tis
a
venial
slip
but
if
i
give
my
wife
a
handkerchief
othello
what
then
iago
why
then
tis
hers
my
lord
and
being
hers
she
may
i
think
bestow
t
on
any
man
othello
she
is
protectress
of
her
honour
too
may
she
give
that
iago
her
honour
is
an
essence
that
s
not
seen
they
have
it
very
oft
that
have
it
not
but
for
the
handkerchief
othello
by
heaven
i
would
most
gladly
have
forgot
it
thou
said
st
it
comes
o
er
my
memory
as

the
raven
o

the
infected
house
boding
to
all
he
had
my
handkerchief
iago
ay
what
of
that
othello
that
s
not
so
good
now
iago
what
if
i
had
said
i
had
seen
him
do
you
wrong
or
heard
him
say
as
knaves
be
such
abroad
who
having
by
their
own
importunate
suit
or
voluntary
dotage
of
some
mistress
convinced
or
supplied
them
cannot
choose
but
they
must
blab
othello
hath
he
said
any
thing
iago
he
hath
my

but
be
you
well
assured
no
more
than

ll
unswear
othello
what

mock
to

in

couch
and
to

i
know
what
she
shall
be
othello
o

iago
stand
you
awhile
apart
confine
yourself
but
in
a
patient
list
whilst
you
were
here
o
erwhelmed
with
your
grief
a
passion
most
unsuiting
such
a
man
cassio
came
hither
i
shifted
him
away
and
laid
good
scuse
upon
your
ecstasy
bade
him
anon
return
and
here
speak
with
me
the
which
he
promised
do
but
encave
yourself
and
mark
the
fleers
the
gibes
and
notable
scorns
that
dwell
in
every
region
of
his
face
for
i
will
make
him
tell
the
tale
anew
where
how
how
oft
how
long
ago
and
when
he
hath
and
is
again
to
cope
your
wife
i
say
but
mark
his
gesture
marry
patience
or
i
shall
say
you
are
all
in
all
in
spleen
and
nothing
of
a
man
othello
dost
thou
hear
iago
i
will
be
found
most
cunning
in
my
patience
but
dost
thou
hear
most
bloody
iago

not
amiss
but
yet
keep
time
in
all

refrain
from
the
excess
of
laughter
here

mass
of

i
pray
you

but
his
humour

i
warrant
trumpets

hark
how

how
now
roderigo
roderigo
i
do
not
find
that
thou
dealest
justly
with
me
iago
what
in
the
contrary
roderigo
every
day
thou
daffest
me
with
some
device
iago
and
rather
as
it
seems
to
me
now
keepest
from
me
all
conveniency
than
suppliest
me
with
the
least
advantage
of
hope
i
will
indeed
no
longer
endure
it
nor
am
i
yet
persuaded
to
put
up
in
peace
what
already
i
have
foolishly
suffered
iago
will
you
hear
me
roderigo
roderigo
faith
i
have
heard
too
much
for
your
words
and
performances
are
no
kin
together
iago
you
charge
me
most
unjustly
roderigo
with
nought
but
truth
i
have
wasted
myself
out
of
my
means
the
jewels
you
have
had
from
me
to
deliver
to
desdemona
would
half
have
corrupted
a
votarist
you
have
told
me
she
hath
received
them
and
returned
me
expectations
and
comforts
of
sudden
respect
and
acquaintance
but
i
find
none
iago
well
go
to
very
well
roderigo
very
well
go
to
i
cannot
go
to
man
nor
tis
not
very
well
nay
i
think
it
is
scurvy
and
begin
to
find
myself
fobbed
in
it
iago
very
well
roderigo
i
tell
you
tis
not
very
well
i
will
make
myself
known
to
desdemona
if
she
will
return
me
my
jewels
i
will
give
over
my
suit
and
repent
my
unlawful
solicitation
if
not
assure
yourself
i
will
seek
satisfaction
of
you
iago
you
have
said
now
roderigo
ay
and
said
nothing
but
what
i
protest
intendment
of
doing
iago
why
now
i
see
there
s
mettle
in
thee
and
even
from
this
instant
to
build
on
thee
a
better
opinion
than
ever
before
give
me
thy
hand
roderigo
thou
hast
taken
against
me
a
most
just
exception
but
yet
i
protest
i
have
dealt
most
directly
in
thy
affair
roderigo
it
hath
not
appeared
iago
i
grant
indeed
it
hath
not
appeared
and
your
suspicion
is
not
without
wit
and
judgment
but
roderigo
if
thou
hast
that
in
thee
indeed
which
i
have
greater
reason
to
believe
now
than
ever
i
mean
purpose
courage
and
valour
this
night
show
it
if
thou
the
next
night
following
enjoy
not
desdemona
take
me
from
this
world
with
treachery
and
devise
engines
for
my
life
roderigo
well
what
is
it
is
it
within
reason
and
compass
iago
sir
there
is
especial
commission
come
from
venice
to
depute
cassio
in
othello

place
roderigo
is
that
true
why
then
othello

desdemona
return
again
to
venice
iago
o
no
he
goes
into
mauritania
and
takes
away
with
him
the
fair
desdemona
unless
his
abode
be
lingered
here
by
some
accident
wherein
none
can
be
so
determinate
as
the
removing
of
cassio
roderigo
how
do
you
mean
removing
of
him
iago
why
by
making
him
uncapable
of
othello
s
place
knocking
out
his
brains
roderigo
and
that
you
would
have
me
to
do
iago
ay
if
you
dare
do
yourself
a
profit
and
a
right
he

to
night
with
a
harlotry
and
thither
will
i
go
to
him
he
knows
not
yet
of
his
horrorable
fortune
if
you
will
watch
his
going
thence
which
i
will
fashion
to
fall
out
between
twelve
and
one
you
may
take
him
at
your
pleasure
i
will
be
near
to
second
your
attempt
and
he
shall
fall
between
us
come
stand
not
amazed
at
it
but
go
along
with
me
i
will
show
you
such
a
necessity
in
his
death
that
you
shall
think
yourself
bound
to
put
it
on
him
it
is
now
high
suppertime
and
the
night
grows
to
waste
about
it
roderigo

tis
a
wrong
in
your
own
world
and
you
might
quickly
make
it
right
desdemona
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
woman
emilia
yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
to
the
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
played
for
but
i
do
think
it
is
their
husbands
faults
if
wives
do
fall
say
that
they
slack
their
duties
and
pour
our
treasures
into
foreign
laps
or
else
break
out
in
peevish
jealousies
throwing
restraint
upon
us
or
say
they
strike
us
or
scant
our
former
having
in
despite
why
we
have
galls
and
though
we
have
some
grace
yet
have
we
some
revenge
let
husbands
know
their
wives
have
sense
like
them
they
see
and
smell
and
have
their
palates
both
for
sweet
and
sour
as
husbands
have
what
is
it
that
they
do
when
they
change
us
for
others
is
it
sport
i
think
it
is
and
doth
affection
breed
it
i
think
it
doth
is
t
frailty
that
thus
errs
it
is
so
too
and
have
not
we
affections
desires
for
sport
and
frailty
as
men
have
then
let
them
use
us
well
else
let
them
know
the
ills
we
do
their
ills
instruct
us

jealous
